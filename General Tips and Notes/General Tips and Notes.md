## General Tips and Notes

This is a collection of general tips and notes that do not apply to one specific airframe.

### Flying with a new player

It is not uncommon to share DCS with a new player so as to either show them what DCS has to offer or to teach them how to fly. In either case, there are a few things to take note of to reduce the amount of pain points.

#### Buying the Flaming Cliffs 3 Aircraft Pack

Where possible, this should be the starting point for new players. It would be best to look out for a sale and convince them to buy the FC3 aircraft where possible. This is because the aircraft within FC3 are low-fidelity modules but are arguably more iconic than the 2 default free offerings in DCS. This has the twofold effect of getting new players monetarily invested in the game as well as heightens the chance that they will have a plane they are interested in to learn flying well.

#### Flying the SU-25T "Frogfoot"

If the new player does not buy a module and is simply trying out the free modules, chances are that they will be flying in SU-25T "Frogfoot". The SU-25T is a capable aircraft on its own, but it will hardly be appealing to most players. To avoid frustration, try to fly along with an SU-25T of your own and try getting them to emulate your aircraft movements, this will get them acquainted with the sluggish flying characteristics of the aircraft. 

#### Combat

If engaged, refrain from teaching new concepts to the new pilot. The amount of workload required to engage an enemy is high enough as it is. While it might be tempting to go over a new concept that might be helpful for the immediate moment, it only serves to confuse the new player if introduced in the middle of concept. Such concepts might include: radar PRF settings, explaining quirks of the Russian RWR, etc.
