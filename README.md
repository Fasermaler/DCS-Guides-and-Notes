## DCS Guides and Notes

The world of Digital Combat Simulator (DCS) is a rich and deep one, a unique (primarily) flight simulator with a massive focus on military aircraft and combat. The aircraft in the game range from WW2 propeller driven aircraft to 4th generation fighter jets. Each aircraft is meticulously modelled and crafted, ensuring a deep and satisfying experience.

However, the DCS is a difficult game to get into - with depth, comes complexity; not just from the flight systems themselves, but the combat systems that come along with it. Aspiring virtual pilots will have to contend with basic aircraft maneuvering as well as the various combat and tactical maneuvers required to engage the enemy.

While information on DCS on how to fly individual aircraft (often referred to as a "module") is not sparse by any means, the amount of full-length written guides are few and good advice is scattered all over the internet (on sites such as the [Eagle Dynamics Forums](https://forums.eagle.ru/) the [r/hoggit](reddit.com/r/hoggit) subreddit, youtube comments and more.). Thus, this repository aims to collate such information as far as possible. 



Note from the Author: Unfortunately, I am but one person overloaded with a multitude of projects, thus the updates to this repository may be slow. I am also by no means an expert in DCS, which is also the reason why I have created this for my own reference.
